New upgrades (hopefully):
 - Increase performance (better colision detection and handling).
 - More interractables (cubes, pressure buttons).
 - More levels.
 - Bigger levels (scrollable maps, only horizontally).
 - More diverse sprites / tiles.
 - Add player hazards (pits, toxis pools, rocket turrets maybe ?)
